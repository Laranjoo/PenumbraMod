[Mod in Development]

Penumbra Mod is a content mod that adds new stuff to the game, such as expanding biomes content with a lot of items and changes, and reworking much vanilla items with new mechanics and behaviours, and including a lot of references of various games (Real gamers will get the reference),  And a brand new class! (The Reaper Class).

>> What is the reaper class? <<
The reaper class is entirely based on scythes, when you hold a scythe, you get the reaper energy mechanic. 

>> How the reaper class works? <<
If you start dealing damage, the bar increases, when it gets to the final, each scythe uses its own special ability [By clicking your set keybind], they variate to buffs/debuffs, projectiles, and even throwing your scythe!

>> What about the special abilities? <<
Every scythe has its own special ability, they will have the description telling to you for what the scythe will do, so be strategic on using them!

>> But scythes aren't melee weapons? <<
Its your choice to decide if it is a class/subclass, this was made for entertaining and content purposes, so don't judge.
